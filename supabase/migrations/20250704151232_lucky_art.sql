  # Fix RLS policy for contact form submissions

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing INSERT policy that's not working correctly
    - Create new INSERT policy that properly allows anonymous submissions
    - Ensure the policy allows both anonymous and authenticated users to submit contact forms

  2. Policy Changes
    - Remove the problematic "Allow anonymous contact submissions" policy
    - Add a new policy with proper conditions for anonymous submissions
*/

-- Drop the existing INSERT policy that's causing issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous contact submissions" ON contact_submissions;

-- Create a new INSERT policy that properly allows anonymous submissions
CREATE POLICY "Enable contact form submissions for everyone"
  ON contact_submissions
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Ensure the existing SELECT policies remain intact
-- (They should already exist based on the schema, but let's verify they work correctly)

-- Update the SELECT policy for authenticated users to be more permissive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read for own submissions" ON contact_submissions;
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for authenticated users"
  ON contact_submissions
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- The service role policy should remain as is
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read for service role" ON contact_submissions;
-- CREATE POLICY "Enable read for service role"
--   ON contact_submissions
--   FOR SELECT
--   TO service_role
--   USING (true);
